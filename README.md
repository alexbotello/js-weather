# js-weather
Web App prototype that displays weather temperature, wind speed, cloudiness, and humidity.
A default api key is hard coded for anyone who wants to test this web app. Just clone and run code :)
Layout is only optimized for a full screen browser window
Art design idea is courtesy of my 6 year old daughter.

### Test
1. Git clone this repo onto your local machine
2. Run ```node server.js```
3. Point browser to ```localhost:3000```
