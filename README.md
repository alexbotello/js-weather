# js-weather
Web App prototype that displays weather temperature, wind speed, cloudiness, and humidity.

A default api key is hard coded for anyone who wants to test this web app. Just clone and run code :)

Layout is only optimized for a full screen browser window

Art design idea is courtesy of my 6 year old daughter.
